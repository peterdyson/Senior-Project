I've managed to complete the CodeAcademy tutorial for java. I now have a basic understanding of the structure of java and simple commands. I've downloaded Android Studio which will be my coding environment for the project. I have also borrowed an Android phone from the innovations lab which will serve as a test device as I progress.

First day of Senior projects! I'm beginning to realize what I've gotten myself into. I just finished reading through the guide on how to make your first app. Seems very challenging. The course on how to use all the api's says it requires three years of coding experience. I've got about three weeks. This is going to be so much fun. Also I've been sick all day so I've been very unproductive.

I finally found the developer controls on the phone! Only took an hour or so. Turns out ZTE phones hide them in a different place than standard Android phones. It's under a different tab and labeled differently. Plus they make it so you have to tap the icon four times before the developer controls get turned on. 

Spent the last couple of hours trying to get the phone to connect to the Android Studios. I can access the files on the phone but the studios won't recognize the phone as a device. No idea why. I have tried changing the way the phone connects, MTP and PTP, most of the developer controls and tried installing google usb software. None of it has worked. Very frustrated with this whole thing.
