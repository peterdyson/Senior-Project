I've managed to complete the CodeAcademy tutorial for java. I now have a basic understanding of the structure of java and simple commands. I've downloaded Android Studio which will be my coding environment for the project. I have also borrowed an Android phone from the innovations lab which will serve as a test device as I progress.

First day of Senior projects! I'm beginning to realize what I've gotten myself into. I just finished reading through the guide on how to make your first app. Seems very challenging. The course on how to use all the api's says it requires three years of coding experience. I've got about three weeks. This is going to be so much fun. Also I've been sick all day so I've been very unproductive.
