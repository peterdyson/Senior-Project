I've managed to complete the CodeAcademy tutorial for java. I now have a basic understanding of the structure of java and simple commands. I've downloaded Android Studio which will be my coding environment for the project. I have also borrowed an Android phone from the innovations lab which will serve as a test device as I progress.
